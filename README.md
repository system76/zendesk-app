---

This repository contains some [zendesk apps](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps)
that enhance the workflow for System76 employees working in Zendesk. While this
repository is open source, the applications are very specific to our work flow
and will be of no use in other people's instance of Zendesk. We keep this
repository open in hopes people can see, learn, and possibly enhance how we
create these apps.

## Requirements

- A recent version of `node`
- The [Zendesk App Tools](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/developer-guide/zat)

## Setup

Simply `cd` into the app you are interested in and run `npm ci` to install
the dependencies.

You will also want to add the app you are working on to a zendesk instance. At
System76, we have a staging instance of Zendesk that we do all of our testing
on.
